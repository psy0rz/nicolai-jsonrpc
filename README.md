# Nicolai JSON RPC library

## Usage

### The RPC class

Creating an API is done by instantiating the RPC class with

Optional parameters:

- An identity: a string containing the name of the API
- A session manager object which implements a getSession(token) function which returns a session

A session may implement the following functions:

- setConnection(connection)
- checkPermission(method) -> bool : a function which returns a boolean indicating weither or not the requested method may be executed

### The webserver class

### The session manager class


### Nginx webserver as a reverse proxy

Add the following snippet to the `server` section of your Nginx configuration:

```
  location /api/ {
      proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
      proxy_http_version 1.1;
      proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
      proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
  }
```

This will forward all requests (both HTTP and Websockets) to the RPC server running in Node. Nginx will still serve all other paths on the server. It can also supply a secure HTTPS connection to the outside world, without making changes to your application.

If Nginx or another reverse proxy is used make sure to limit direct access to the API server to localhost, to prevent direct connections from the outside world.

```
var webserver = new Webserver({
    port: 8000,
    host: "127.0.0.1", // Only listen to localhost
    application: rpc
});
```

## Examples

### Basic usage of the RPC library

The example `rpc_only.js` demonstrates the basic usage of the RPC library.

### Using the included webserver

The example `webserver_simple.js` demonstrates using the RPC library in combination with the included webserver.

### Using the session manager

The example `webserver_sessionmanager.js`demonstrates using the RPC library in combination with the included webserver and the included session manager.
